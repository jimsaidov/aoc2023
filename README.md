## Intro AOC 2023
Welcome to the Advent of Code[^aoc] Kotlin project created by [jimsaidov][github] using the [Advent of Code Kotlin Template][template] delivered by JetBrains.


[^aoc]:
[Advent of Code][aoc] â€“ An annual event of Christmas-oriented programming challenges started December 2015.
Every year since then, beginning on the first day of December, a programming puzzle is published every day for twenty-five days.

## DISCLAIMER
These solutions are solely aim on solving the given puzzle and are not intended to be used as a reference for best practices or idiomatic Kotlin code. I might never use such code in a real project. Though I might get back to some solutions and refactor them at a later stage, once have more time.
